     * @brief The fineftp::TransferFtpServer is a simple FTP manager library.

     *   1. Create an instance
     *   2. Add a user
     *   3. Start the manager
     *
     * Then your manager is up and running. In code it will look like this:
     *
     * @code{.cpp}
     *
     *   fineftp::TransferFtpServer manager(2121);
     *   manager.addUserAnonymous("C:\\", fineftp::Permission::All);
     *   manager.StartServer();
